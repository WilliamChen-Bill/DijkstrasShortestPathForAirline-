    Haversine formula: 
            ⁃	a = sin²(Δφ/2) + cos φ1 ⋅ cos φ2 ⋅ sin²(Δλ/2)
            ⁃	c = 2 ⋅ atan2( √a, √(1−a) )
            ⁃	d = R ⋅ c
            where φ is latitude, λ is longitude, R is earth’s radius (mean radius = 6,371km);
            note that angles need to be in radians to pass to trig functions!
